# Course catalog

## How to run project:

``` 
Using Docker :
docker-compose up --build
```
``` 
Using Xamp (This is the Method I used) :
- Place the Folder of This Repositry inside this path "C:\xampp\htdocs\SPA" (Create the Folder Named "SPA")
- start Apache Server
- start Xamp MySQL
- create Database named "kc-fullstack"
- import migrations to the previous created Database to create the tables 'category' and 'course'
```

## Hosts:
- DB credentials - look at the docker-compose.yml
-Api docs are in swagger.yml
